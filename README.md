# TrackVote Hotkeys

A small plugin that let's you set some hotkeys for the new voting functionality so that you can vote outside of the menu, it also allows you to change the default keys for liking/disliking a map when in the menu (though due to nadeos implementation this selecation is _very_ small xdd)


## Features

- Setup hotkeys for liking/disliking/neutralizing a maps vote outside of the menu
- Change the default key for voting on a map to a very limited selection (keyboard only sorry controller players Sadge) 


## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Sorry controller players, but you cannot use te "Change default menu key" as nadeo used a diffren implementation for this, and changing that is way above my paygrade...


## Prerequisites

- [Trackmania](http://trackmania.com/) game installed
